go to new directory
git init .
git remote add origin https://git...


go to databases
start a console in your database
mysql> SHOW tables

will show all tables

You can delete all the tables here with with oder from child to parents:
mysql>DROP TABLE tasks
query OK, ...
mysql>DROP TABLE lists
query OK, ...
mysql>DROP TABLE users
query OK, ...


then to recreate the tables you have to go to a python3 bash,
(open bash in the location with flask_app, and type python3 and hit enter)
import the app python file and import db from that file and then
call the create_all() command from the db so:

from flask_app import db
db.create_all()

the db has the uri of the pythonanywhere database so you just need to be
in the location of the flasKa_app.py to run this second console.

Then go to web:
Change the source code directory to the new one.
go to the wsgi file and it should be:

import sys

# add your project directory to the sys.path
project_home = '/home/dumi/skeleton-26-12-2020' <--path to directory with flask_app
if project_home not in sys.path:
    sys.path = [project_home] + sys.path

# import flask app but need to call it "application" for WSGI to work
from flask_app import app as application  # noqa
